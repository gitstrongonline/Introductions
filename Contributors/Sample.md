Hi Everyone!
My name is Terry. :man: 
I work for the central IT department at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, VA. :computer: I started there as an intern during my undergrad serving the Computer Science department as a Systems Administrator. These days, I'm wearing many hats as our organization evolves.  Some days I'm working in the Cloud and others in High Performance Computing.  Exciting times! 
Check out my [github](https://github.com/gitstrongonline) profile.

I started seriously lifting about two years ago and the transformative process changed my life.  I wanted to share that feeling with the world so I found the Barbell Logic Coaching Academy and Starting Strength Coaching Development courses to help accelerate my coaching development so that I could help others as soon as possible.  Each day, I continue to learn about what makes a better coach and study essential topics like anatomy, physiology, physics, and biomechanics. :books:
